# PatersonWorms
A JS implementation of Paterson's Worms. The C version also creates an svg file that can be used to compare to the JS version. Obviously, the C version is much faster than the JS version, but you can see the JS one happen in realtime. The JS version also allows you to see the worm grow, as old parts turn darker and the window grows to match the worm's size. Line width can also be customized.

The notation for the choices is borrowed from Martin Gardner's article on Paterson's worms. I learned that there are mutliple notations for these worms out there, but knowledge of the notation is not required to use this program. Be careful, as some of the worms are infinite in length and others are finite but with large (in the millions of steps) length.
